The Day You Became A Better Writer
I went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one-day course in “business writing.” I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you don’t have to waste a day in class.

Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it.

Simple means getting rid of extra words. Don’t write, “He was very happy” when you can write “He was happy.” You think the word “very” adds something. It doesn’t. Prune your sentences.

Humor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, don’t say “drink” when you can say “swill.”

Your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence to this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious. That’s the key.

Write short sentences. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers aren’t as smart as you’d think.

Learn how brains organize ideas. Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.” Both sentences mean the same, but it’s easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way. (Notice I didn’t say, “That is the way all brains work”?)

That’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You’re welcome.

> **Haters are a fact of life.** Not everyone is going to be a fan of you or the content you put out. I see negative comments all the time. Bottom line (and it’s tough to hear): there’s always someone who won’t like you. But, at the end of the day, it’s not going to matter.

> No one wants to read your half-assed shit. No one owes you anything. Start with a story, spend lots of time, share lessons learned or stop it now. Write for your first reader.   

Write to please just one person. Don't try to please anyone but yourself. Kurt Vonnegut 

What's pisses you off: If you think about sometimes more than three times a week, you have to write about it

Use this checklist for writing: [Google Docs - create and edit documents online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xooj7ixxuqOpybuxcp4euFuHjQsJlNrkmLyrJzIykCM/edit)

- [ ] **FOMO**: It feels like buying bitcoin in 2015 for 220EU and selling it today for 8,700EU
- [ ] **No Tautologies**: Customer first, business efficiency, leadership, customer segmentation blablabla. (https://github.com/tarasowski/hec/blob/master/business-strategy/southwest.md)
- [ ] **Use pictures**: In a sense that you can relate your thoughts to pictures other people can imagine.
- [ ] **Quotes and Citations:** Build-in quotes from other experts to increase the credibility of the content
- [ ] **Recognition - Own style**: Find something like Ben Horowitz who is starting with rap rhymes his content. So everyone can recognise the own style. 
- [ ] **First draft:** of anything is shit. Write everything down what you think, don’t care about grammar, don’t care about typos. Don’t try to be perfect, just write as much as possible. First draft needs to be very bad at spelling, grammer.
- [ ] **Simplification check:** Write as simple a possible 
- [ ] **Don’t sell:** don’t try to be a sneaky salesman. Just write good content, people will buy it anyway if the stuff is what people really want.
- [ ] **Make it short:** Remove everything you can to make it short and simple. Also try not too put too many emotions into posts. [7 Lessons From 100+ Failed Startups – ThinkGrowth.org](https://thinkgrowth.org/7-lessons-from-100-failed-startups-2db31984867a)
- [ ] **Be bold:** don’t hedge, don't be wishy-washy, life is short.
- [ ] **Include Hero image:** use https://unsplash.com/ OR https://pixabay.com/
- [ ] **Storytelling:** Always start with a story (how to, infographic). 
* Then there was the one day I lost a million dollars.
* When I ran a company the worst thing was when employees had sex with each other.
Чтобы включить читателя, используйте истории, личный опыт и настоящие иллюстрации. Дайте читателю как можно раньше взаимодействовать с вашим материалом, изучать его самостоятельно, делать самостоятельные выводы. [Соблазнить лекцией. Как захватить внимание читателя](http://maximilyahov.ru/blog/all/smells-like-teen-spirit/) 
- [ ] **Write simple:** it needs to be written simple so everyone can understand. Use simple language and logic connections. “Over time, they have created a set of values. They don’t care about a potential $10 million in revenue. They need an additional $137 million. **Therefore, everyone at Atlassian has a focus on big customers and their needs. And big customers want a bigger, better, more complicated product.”**
- [ ] **Write like you speak & think:**  differentiate your by being personal, try to be authentic, be honest with a reader. 
- [ ] **Observation/Own Experience:** I’m not working for Atlassian. I have no connections to its employees. But I know how it feels when disruptive innovation meets a 15-year-old company. It sucks in all areas! (Великие писатели нечего не придумывают, они списывают с своей жизни. Познер, Дон Кихот - Писатель который писал Дон Кихот он не придумал этот персонаж, он описал жизнь своего родственника. Надо описывать жизнь вокруг, a не придумывать)
- [ ] **Don't give a fuck** about what people will think and say about you and your content. They will hate and this is normal, try to be anti so you’ll get followers
- [ ] **Own experience:** try to project your own experience to the case you describe e.g.  In their minds, Trello is a shitty product compared to Jira. But Atlassian’s CEO secured their jobs and salaries by buying Trello. 
- [ ] **Being the anti-______ :** is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers. Генеральный директор Atlassian в своём блоге написал: «Trello станет важной частью номенклатуры продуктов Atlassian.» Я предполагаю, это значит, что слишком рано говорить правду. Будет как раз наоборот. https://m.signalvnoise.com/ditch-the-elevator-pitch-c4e39b18197c Take a topic which everyone thinks is a standard like the elevator pitch. Write exactly the opposite why everyone is doing it wrong
- [ ] **Make Statements:** I’m sure many of Atlassian’s employees don’t understand this decision. Because it makes no sense for them. In their minds, Trello is a shitty product compared to Jira.
- [ ] **Dialogue with a reader:** use YOU, speak to a reader. Example: here's where staying lean helps you out
- [ ] **Take sides/Provacative:** present ideas in bold strokes than to be wishy-washy about it. We'd rather be provocative than water everything down with "it depends…”
- [ ] **Understandable:**review everything to make it logic and understandable content. Simple language so everyone understands the content.
- [ ] **Short sentences:** 1-8 words sentences, readers understood 100%, with 9-14 (best) word sentences - 90%
- [ ] **Short paragraphs:** on average 3 to 5 sentences per paragraphs
- [ ] **Use examples:** where people can relate to, describe real stuff (Trello/Atlasssian), don’t use generic description of a problem or case, people needs to be connected with the topic
- [ ] **Make it actionable:** show a reader what to do e.g. reader should add a reminder or make a calendar entry
- [ ] **Subheadings:** subheadings make it easy for readers to scan (each half of a page > subheading)
- [ ] **Stay away from buzzwords:** when normal words will do just fine. Don’t talk about “monetization” or being “transparent”; talk about making money and being honest. Don’t use seven words when four will do.
- [ ] **Avoid Adverb:** creative writing advice often harps on about not using adverbs
- [ ] **Use bullet list and infographics:** to make content more scannable
- [ ] **Screenshots & proof:** add screenshots to your posts
- [ ] **Open source information:** make all documents and files created publicly available
- [ ] **Avoid passive voice:** Passive voice is usually weaker writing
- [ ] **Use bolding:** make phrases or sentences more visible for a reader
- [ ] **Give helpful advice:** tips that are off the beaten path perform well, always give an advice to a reader
- [ ] **Make statements, people love it:** “Make something the mainstream market doesn’t want now, but will want later.”
- [ ] **Firm closers:** That’s the future of content marketing. (closing statements/paragraphs that are definitive)
- [ ] **Call to action to share content:** If you enjoyed reading, please support my work by hitting that little heart!
- [ ] **Link to my site:** just place a link after the post or inside the post
- [ ] **Always attribute:** whether quoting, citing or using images
- [ ] **Ask an expert to answer one question:** needs to be topic related, so you can use it as closing paragraph (Getting Real example)
- [ ] **Answer every comment:** Say thank you - Make things that don’t scale!
- [ ] **Create procativacation:** people who hate Jira vs Who love Jira
- [ ] **Share experience:** not opinions
- [ ] **Say thank you:** to every comment you get (make things that don’t scale)
- [ ] TK: write w/o Interruption if something needs researched further. Easy to find since there are no words with TK 
- [ ] **Stadium Pitch:** Ich habe neulich ziemlich krasse Value Prop von einem Zahnarzt gesehen. Die machen Youtube Werbung und die fängt ungefähr so an. Wussten Sie, dass wenn Sie kaputte Zähne haben ihre Lebensdauer verkürzt wird? Alter egal was die danach erzählt haben, ich habe denen alles abgekauft. Das ist so ein krasses Statement / Value prop. Überleg dir doch was in diese Richtung, ich bin mir sicher es ist viel besser als sich auf Features (Vitamine) etc. zu konzentrieren. Ich bin mir sicher, du kannst sowas ähnliches für dein Produkt ausdenken z.B. Wussten Sie wenn Sie Vitamine A,B,C, X, Y nicht nehmen ihre Zähne rausfallen werden? Wollen Sie gesunde Zähne haben? usw. Du musst mit harten Fakten kommen, sonst wirst du ewig lange rumdümpeln.
